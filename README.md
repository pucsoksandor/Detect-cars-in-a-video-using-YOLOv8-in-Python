# Detect-cars-in-a-video-using-YOLOv8-in-Python

In this project, I will present the implementation of training the XOLOv8 model using a preprocessed dataset that I downloaded. The dataset underwent thorough preparation to ensure its suitability for training, and the XOLOv8 model was chosen for its efficiency in handling computer vision tasks. Following the training phase, I conducted testing on the model's performance by evaluating it on a set of video data.

After the training phase, I assessed the model's effectiveness through a testing process conducted on video data. This step is crucial to validate the model's generalization capabilities and its ability to accurately detect and classify objects in real-world scenarios. The following sections will delve into the details of the dataset preparation, training methodology, and the results obtained from the video testing. Through this assignment, I aim to demonstrate the practical application of the XOLOv8 model in computer vision tasks and highlight its performance on a real-world dataset.
